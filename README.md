I have tried many classification models. I have tried hyperparameter tuning for all of them. I tried to use only a few columns which are more relavent to the target. I tried data scaling, data preprocessing , feature selection, but still I couldn't figure out how to get the best score. I have uploaded all my experiments with the models. Some of them may be incomplete, some not up to the mark.I have also repeatedly modified the models, so you may not find my best model in the notebooks.
